This role installs CubicSDR.

<!--more-->

> CubicSDR is a cross-platform Software-Defined Radio application which allows you to navigate the radio spectrum and demodulate any signals you might discover.  It currently includes several common analog demodulation schemes such as AM and FM and will support digital modes in the future.  Many digital decoding applications are available now that can use the analog outputs to process digital signals by “piping” the data from CubicSDR to another program using software like Soundflower, Jack Audio or VBCable.
