> WSJT-X, WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR are open-source programs designed for weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio.  Normal usage requires a standard SSB transceiver and a personal computer with soundcard, or the equivalent.  SDR-style hardware including the SDR-IQ, Perseus, SoftRock, and FUNcube Dongle is supported by MAP65 and WSPR.  SimJT is a utility program that generates simulated signals for test purposes.
